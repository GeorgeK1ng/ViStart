Since it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find the TLBs required to compile ViStart I have attached them here. Find "All TLBs" to grab them all in one convenient package. 

## Libraries
- [Windows Unicode API TypeLib](https://github.com/badcodes/vb6/blob/master/%5BInclude%5D/TypeLib/winu.tlb) - Windows API, stores all the API declarations
- [dseaman@uol.com.br GDI+ Type Library 1.05](http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Type_Libraries/GDIPlus_Type_Library/article.asp)
- [Extended GDIPlusWrapper](https://github.com/lee-soft/GDIPlusWrapper) - Extended GDIPlusWrapper used for OOP GDIPlus
- [All TLBs](https://lee-soft.com/bin/TLB.zip)

## Installation

- Install [GDIPlusWrapper library](https://github.com/lee-soft/GDIPlusWrapper/releases) extract contents of GDIPlusWrapper to any permanent directory and run install script
- Extract ViStart contents to any directory and run ViStart executable

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo
- Ensure you have Visual Basic 6.0(Service Pack 6) installed
- Grab the SHELLLNK, WinU and GDIPlus TLB - extract the TLBs and add as a reference to the project
- Grab the release of the [GDIPlusWrapper library](https://github.com/lee-soft/GDIPlusWrapper/releases) and re-add it as a reference to this project
- Compile and enjoy

## Acknowledgements

I have been unable to contact the original author of the vbAccelerator GDIPlusWrapper (steve@vbaccelerator.com). Permission to include his library here is pending and until it is approved I will not be able to include it here.
